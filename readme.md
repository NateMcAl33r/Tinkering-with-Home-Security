Introduction
-------------------
The goal for the project, Tinkering with Home Security is to create a basic security system using sensors and the raspberry pi or Arduino. This security system will activate when motion is detected or a door/window is opened or closed and will send an alert to a website or app indicating what was opened or what room the motion was detected in. The sensors will be installed and connected to various wires located around the ground and basement floors of the building (B. Dueck’s Property).

For this project to be successful, the following are required; a Raspberry Pi or Arduino, sensors, computer and wiring. The Arduino/Raspberry Pi are needed to run the program that will be needed to make the sensors send information, the sensors are needed to detect change in the area its in (Opening doors, movement, etc…), the computer is needed to write and download the program into the Arduino/Raspberry Pi and the wiring is to hook everything up in one spot and connect it to power.

# Phase 1 Steps
1. Research Diff Between Arduino and Raspberry Pi (mini computers) and their port capabilities.
2. Obtain correct amount of sensors so that there is one for each wire.
3. Write write on chosen PC and send to the "mini-computer".
4. Create basic app and/or website that will be used to view information.
5. Mount all sensors in desired positions and connect to "mini-computer".
6. Run code and Test.
